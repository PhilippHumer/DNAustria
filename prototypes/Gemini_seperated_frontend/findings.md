# Gemini Frontend Development Process
We attempted to separate frontend and backend development to make work easier for the AI models by reducing context.

## Experiment Setup
This frontend development belongs to the backend implementation with Raptor.
The frontend was developed with the Copilot model Gemini 3 Pro.
As a starting point, the initial prompt was used with the note to generate frontend code only.
